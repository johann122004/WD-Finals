## Overview

<!-- TODO: To be changed -->
<!-- The following are just sample -->
The project is the Final Project for Web Design with Client Side Scripting. It's a portfolio website that has 5 pages, designed to show the skills and web development knowledge the creator of the website has learned.

Guiding Question:
- What is the project
- Whats the purpose
- What are key components
- What technology used and how it is used

### Key Components
<!-- TODO: List of Key Components -->
- MultiPage Website
- Hover Animation
- Personal and Resume Information
- Links to other projects, including their repositories


### Explanation
#### How are the files are structured?
- Files are structured by separating the main index.html of the landing page with the assets folder and the pages folders.
- the assets folders contain the css, js, and img subfolders, the css subfolder contains the css file, the js subfolder contains the javascript file, and the img subfolder contains all of the images used for the webpage.
- The pages folder contains the subfolders that contain the contents of the multiple webpages. Each subfolder also has it's own index.html, and assets subfolder.

### Technology

![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

## Deployment
### How to Deploy the Website?
1. Navigate your project repository page on the Github website and click settings.
2. Click "Pages" and click "Deploy from a branch".
3. Click "Github Actions", Find "Static HTML" and click "Configure".
4. Click "Commit changes..." twice.
